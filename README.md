## How to add a new time unit

1. Create a new `.vue` component (`./components/time-[UNIT_NAME].vue`). Important to note you must use the `time-` prefix here!
2. Register the new `[UNIT_NAME]` within the `timeUnitsSupported` array found within `./store/time`. Doing this will add it into the site-wide navigation.
3. Voila. That's it!

### Standard units

`Day.js`, the library that handles most all of the time logic throughout the app, has some pretty handy methods for comparing `now` against any unit you can dream up. For standard units like second, minute, hour, etc., you can use `endOf()`. Check out `./components/time-month.vue` for an example.

### Nonstandard units

For non-standard units - say for example, a `scaramucci` (10 days) â€“ we take a more hands-on approach. First, we figure out how many milliseconds long that time unit is. In this case we use a handy lil function that converts days to milliseconds called `daysToMsec`. We then compare `now` against that time unit duration. Check out `./components/time-scaramucci.vue` for an in-depth example.

## How to add a new visualization

1. Create a new `.vue` component (`./components/visualizations/[NAME].vue`). Important to note you must include this within the `visualizations` directory!
2. Register the new `[NAME]` within the `styleList` array found within `./store/ui`. Doing this will add it into the site-wide navigation.
3. Voila. That's it!
